  There are 21 groups of order 1875.

  The groups of order p^4q are solvable by Burnside's pq-Theorem.
  These groups are sorted by their Sylow subgroups.
     SOT 1 - 15 are nilpotent and all Sylow subgroups are normal.
     SOT 16 is sovable, non-nilpotentand has a normal abelian Sylow 5-subgroup [ 625, 2 ],
         with cyclic Sylow 3-subgroup .
     SOT 17 is sovable, non-nilpotentand has a normal abelian Sylow 5-subgroup [ 625, 11 ],
         with cyclic Sylow 3-subgroup .
     SOT 18 - 19 are sovable, non-nilpotentand have a normal elementary abelian Sylow 5-subgroup [ 625, 15 ],
         with cyclic Sylow 3-subgroup .
     SOT 20 is sovable, non-nilpotentand has a normal nonabelian Sylow 5-subgroup [ 625, 14 ],
         with cyclic Sylow 3-subgroup .
     SOT 21 is sovable, non-nilpotentand has a normal nonabelian Sylow 5-subgroup [ 625, 12 ],
         with cyclic Sylow 3-subgroup .
